# Image Classifier using Convolutional Neural Network
This repo is intended as an introduction to building Neural Networks using the deep learning library PyTorch. The parameter sizes of hidden layers are mentioned in the notebook.

## Overview of architecture:
CONV -> ReLU -> MAXPOOL -> CONV -> ReLU -> MAXPOOL -> FC -> FC
